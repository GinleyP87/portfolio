                    Going through life, I never really found something I wanted to do. My first major at Tri-C was IT Networking, and i was interested in it... unfortunately I don't think I had the attention span for college back then. I changed majors one or two more times before I stopped going. Working in nursing homes, getting into the pipefitters union, never really felt a passion for any of that, I am on my computer a lot though. Someone got to talking to me about them changing careers and they mentioned this bootcamp that they did. The more i read, the more videos i started watching on youtube, the more interested i became. Why wouldn't i be interested in how these things i use everyday get made and maintained. 
                </br>
                </br>
                    I feel like I have finally found something to be passionate about. Even though I have just barely started learning, I've never been more motivated to succeed in anything ever before. I am looking forward to sharing my future projects with you as I grow and learn in this industry.
